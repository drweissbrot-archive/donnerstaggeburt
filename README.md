# donnerstaggeburt

A little Twitter bot. You can find the original at https://twitter.com/donnerstageburt.

To set donnerstaggeburt up, you'll need access to a server. Almost everything donnerstaggeburt does is powered by a simple crontab entry:

```
0 8 * * * php /path/to/donnerstaggeburt.php
```

And yeah, it's based on PHP.

By the way, I wrote this version of the bot on GitHub, so I have actually never tried out if this version works or not.
